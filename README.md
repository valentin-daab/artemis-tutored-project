## What is it ?

A data analysis comparing [entsoe transparency platform](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/) and eurostat energy indicators :
- Installed capacity per production type
- Installed capacity per production unit (aggregated by country)
- Actual generation per production type
- Actual generation per production unit (aggregated by country)

The data was extracted from the entsoe API using the [entso-py](https://github.com/EnergieID/entsoe-py) python client.

The data is visualized using dynamic charts and tables in excel, using pivot tables and the index function.
